            <p class="text-dark">Amun-Ra was the local god of Karnak (Luxor) and during the New Kingdom, when the princes of Thebes ruled Egypt, he became the preeminent state god, with a temple that reflected his status. At the height of its power, the temple owned 421,000 head of cattle, 65 cities, 83 ships and 276,400 hectares of agricultural land and had 81,000 people working for it. The shell that remains, sacked by Assyrians and Persians, is still one of the world's great archaeological sites, grand, beautiful and inspiring.</p>

            <p class="text-dark">The west bank of Luxor had been the site of royal burials since around 2100 BC, but it was the pharaohs of the New Kingdom period (1550–1069 BC) who chose this isolated valley dominated by the pyramid-shaped mountain peak of Al Qurn (The Horn). Once called the Great Necropolis of Millions of Years of Pharaoh, or the Place of Truth, the Valley of the Kings has 63 magnificent royal tombs.</p>

            <p class="text-dark">Karnak is an extraordinary complex of sanctuaries, kiosks, pylons and obelisks dedicated to the Theban triad but also to the greater glory of pharaohs. The site covers more than 2 sq km; it's large enough to contain about 10 cathedrals. At its heart is the Temple of Amun, the earthly 'home' of the local god. Built, added to, dismantled, restored, enlarged and decorated over nearly 1500 years, Karnak was the most important place of worship in Egypt during the New Kingdom...</p>

              <p class="text-dark">front of the Entrance Pylon of Ramses II, he placed six colossal statues of himself, four standing and two seated. He also erected two granite obelisks inscribed with his names and titles - one is now in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The vertical grooves in the front section of each tower of the pylon were for the insertion of standards. The square openings above them held braces. Both towers were decorated with reliefs of Ramses' Battle of Kadesh. They are not in good condition and are somewhat difficult to see. On the right-hand tower (a) are reliefs of the Egyptian camp with Ramses II consulting with his military commanders. On the lefthand tower (b) he charges the enemy, managing to keep them engaged until reinforcements arrive..</p>

              <p >On the right-hand rear wall of the Court is an interesting representation (at c). It shows the facade of the temple of Luxor, with one seated and two standing colossi and one obelisk on each side of the entrance gateway. The flag-staffs are in position and pennants flutter. Approaching (from the right) are some of Ramses II's sons. Behind them are fattened sacrificial animals being led by nobles. Some of the bulls have decorated horns; one has metal tips in the form of hands. Queen Nefertari is shown shaking two sistra. Behind her are princes and princesses. Ramses II had at least 111 sons and 67 daughters..</p>

              <p class="text-dark">The Court of Amenhotep III (C) is a fine example of the architecture of the 18th Dynasty. The double row of columns have clustered papyrus-bud capitals and are in a good state of preservation. There were originally roofing blocks across the architraves, but the spacious central part of the court was open to the sky. The side colonnades end, in the south, with a group of columns arranged in four rows of eight, which is usually called the Hypostyle Hall (D). Immediately to the rear is that part of the temple that was converted into a Roman shrine after the removal of some columns; the doorway leading to the Sanctuary was walled into a curved recess; the reliefs were covered with plaster and painted over with the figures of Roman emperors.

The procession makes its way upstream; the king's chariot is on a boat, which is towed like the sacred barge of Amon (f). Finally, there is a sacrifice of slaughtered animals (g) and offerings to Amon, Mut and Khonsu at Luxor temple (h) with great fanfare. 9 On the opposite wall the return procession is shown: sacrificial bulls are led by soldiers, standard-bearers, dancers and Nubian slaves (i). The barges float downstream (), and the final sacrifice and offerings are made to Amon and Mut at Karnak temple (k).
